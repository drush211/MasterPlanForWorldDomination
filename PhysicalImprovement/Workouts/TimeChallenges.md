# Time Challenges

## Push-up Challenge

  * Total Push-ups: 200
  * PB: [~9:00][Push-Up Challenge]
  * Tips: Smaller rep amounts early to save strength for later.

This is a simple challenge, where you attempt to do 200 push-ups as fast as
possible. Simple as it sounds, get a stop watch, hit start, and begin. My
personal best is under 9:00 (can't remember the exact value, but it is in the
8 minute range, so I'll round up).

A tip for this is to try to minimize your rep counts early to retain strength
for later. The first 100 push-ups are 10x easier than the last 100, so don't
just rip out 100 as fast as possible and then burn out.

## Pull-up Challenge

  * Total Pull-ups: 50
  * PB: [5:20][Pull-Up Challenge]
  * Tips: Smaller rep amounts early to save strength for later.

This is a simple challenge, where you attempt to do 50 pull-ups as fast as
possible. Simple as it sounds, get a stop watch, hit start, and begin. Something
to do here would be to expand to 75 pull-ups for an even greater challenge.

A tip for this is to try to minimize your rep counts early to retain strength
for later. The first 25 pull-ups are 10x easier than the last 25, so don't
just rip out 25 as fast as possible and then burn out.

## Squat Challenge

  * Total Air Squats: 125
  * PB: [7:41][Squat Challenge]
  * Tips: Smaller rep amounts early to save strength for later.

This is a simple challenge, where you attempt to do 125 air squats as fast as
possible. Simple as it sounds, get a stop watch, hit start, and begin. I've yet
to do this challenge, but it's on the agenda.

## Crunch Challenge

  * Total Crunches: 150
  * PB: [3:27][Crunch Challenge]
  * Tips: Smaller rep amounts early to save strength for later.

This is a simple challenge, where you attempt to do 150 crunches as fast as
possible. Simple as it sounds, get a stop watch, hit start, and begin. I've yet

  * PB: [9:12][Dips Challenge]
  * Tips: Smaller rep amounts early to save strength for later.

This is a simple challenge, where you attempt to do 125 dips as fast as
possible. Simple as it sounds, get a stop watch, hit start, and begin. I've yet
to do this challenge, but it's on the agenda.

A tip for this is to try to minimize your rep counts early to retain strength
for later.
