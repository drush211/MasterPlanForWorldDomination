## Pyramids

Pyramids are a great break from the normal routine, but I wouldn't suggest doing
them often. An example pyramid is a 12/8/5/8/12 rep routine for an exercise,
where the goal is to use a weight for the 5 rep set, that you would usually use
at the third set of a 3x5. After that you are trying to deplete your muscles as
much as possible with the 8 and 12. Pyramids (in my opinion) are for "to
exhaustion" routines. Your first 2 sets should be adequately difficult, but
shouldn't compromise your 3rd set of 5.
