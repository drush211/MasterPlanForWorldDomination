# Runbook Name

Small blurb about what this runbook is used for. Ideally this includes some good keywords so it can be found via git or
grep.

## How to Recognize

This should tell you how to make sure this is the time to use this runbook. It's possible that this situation could be
similar to something else, so you want to be as specific as possible on when this is the correct manual to run.

## How to Recover

This is where you detail out the recovery steps for solving the situation. Ideally there is a script that can be run,
but that does not mean you shouldn't list out all of the steps here. This manual should be able to exist independently
of the script(s) used to rectify the situation.
