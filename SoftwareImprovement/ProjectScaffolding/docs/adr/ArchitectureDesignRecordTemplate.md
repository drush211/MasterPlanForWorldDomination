## Context

At some point in all projects a decision about the design of the project will have to be made. At that point you need to
make a decision about what needs to happen, and that decision should be documented with as much information as possible.

This template is based off of the article found [here](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_by_michael_nygard.md).

## Decision

Projects going forward will always have an ADR when there are a few different approaches to a problem. To determine if
something needs an ADR ask yourself, "Was there ever a point that I really considered doing this another way?". If the
answer to that question is no, then you likely don't need an ADR. ADRs are also for designs, not implementations of
designs, so those are unnecessary as well.

## Consequences

### Pros

* Record of why a decision was made.

### Cons

* Can get out of date if the design later changes and this isn't updated
