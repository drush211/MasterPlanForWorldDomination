# SLAs

For this I'm specifically talking about internal SLAs, but in general SLAs are
useful (and most times required) externally as well. The reason they are useful
internally is to reduce confusion. If I create an internal SLA with a team, we
both know the expectations for handling a situation. There shouldn't be any more
questions like "Who needs to investigate?", "Are the responses correct?", "Are
these response times ok?". SLAs pre-define all of those to eliminate confusion.
I would equate it to building up an API. Would you rather have concrete
information, or just an idea? The SLA is really just an extension of the API,
where it talks to the operational aspects. I feel like operationalization is
lacking as far as awareness in the industry (per my experience, results may vary
obviously), and SLAs are a huge part of making a product operational. I would
personally say that a product without an SLA is only experimental, or should be
treated as such. That doesn't mean it's unusable, but a service you don't have
hard expectations for is pretty hard to rely upon in production.
