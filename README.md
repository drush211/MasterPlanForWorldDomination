# MasterPlanForWorldDomination

This is where I lay out all of my plans for complete and total World Domination.

## Physical Improvement

I try to keep ideas and workouts I use for physical improvement in this
[repo][1]. It includes meals, workouts, and general exercises I find to be most
useful, as well as my techniques I use to make the gains. This is always
adjusting of course, as there are always new things I learn to try out.

## Software Improvement

I'm a Software Developer by trade, and I try to keep notes on things I've seen
to be useful in the industry. There are more conceptual than concrete as every
situation is different.

## Movie and TV Improvement

Used to keep track of the must see Movies and Television shows.
